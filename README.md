# AIV-files-for-Stronghold-Crusader, for the Vanilla Version

Here You can download 128 AIV files, 8 castles each for every Lord and some alternative AIV files, for the Vanilla version of the game Stronghold Crusader.



For more informations read the README_ENG (english language) or README_GER (german language/deutsch)



If there are problems to download, or you cant get the files via Github, then you can try to download it on Stronghold Heaven
(link: http://stronghold.heavengames.com/downloads/showfile.php?fileid=8495).



Also check out the AIC files from Xander10alpha, who helped me testing my AIV files (link: https://github.com/Xander10alpha/AICs-Xander10alpha).

Or look for my own AIC files, with extra AIV files for it (link: https://github.com/FAPLZ/FAPLZ_AIC).

Both AIC files make the AI more powerfull and effectiv and also work very well with the AIV files you can download here.
